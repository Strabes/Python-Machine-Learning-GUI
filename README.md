# Python-Machine-Learning-GUI
Quick and Dirty GUIs for machine learning in Python

Although not as flexible as writing code from scratch, having a GUI when building a regression/classification/other machine learning model can be very convenient.
I've built a handful of GUIs in Python 2.7 using Tkinter. They general use numpy, pandas, patsy, sklearn and/or statsmodels to fit some sort of model and produce plots of actuals vs. fits.
These programs were built purely for fun.
I do not claim to be good at programming; code is provided as is.
